## Overview

The Infantium plugin allows developers to integrate their apps with [Infantium](http://www.infantium.com), the Cognitive Platform for kids.

## Platform Availability

Currently this project is only availble for Android apps. Keep tuned to the [Infantium blog](https://www.infantium.com/blog/) to receive more info about future releases in new Platforms!

## Current project and the SDK

The current project only implements the Plugin to communicate with the native Android Infantium SDK. As such, the documentation only refers to the Plugin itself. If you wish to know more info about the meaning of the functions and variables found around this Plugin, you can do so at our [Infantium's Developer Center](http://docs.infantium.com). In there you will understand how you can integrate your apps with our platform. We're eager to hear from you!
